# Flutter AlertBox Demo

This is a simple Flutter project demonstrating how to create an Alert Box in a Flutter app. The project uses a `MaterialApp` with a button that triggers the display of an alert dialog when pressed.

## Features
- **Alert Dialog**: A simple alert dialog with a title, message, and a "Close" button.
- **Material 3 Design**: The app uses Flutter's latest Material 3 design guidelines.
- **Stateful Widget**: The project includes a `StatefulWidget` to manage the state of the button interaction.

## Preview
When you press the "Show Alert Box" button, an alert dialog will appear with a title, a message, and a close button to dismiss the dialog.
